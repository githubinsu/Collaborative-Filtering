# Collaborative Filtering for Product Recommendation
## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering involves analyzing the purchase histories of users to calculate the similarity between them. This information is then used to recommend products to each user based on the purchases of other similar users. For example, if “User A and User B have similar purchase histories,” then products purchased by User A but not by User B could be recommended to User B.

## Background
It is important to understand the purchasing behavior of customers in order to provide personalized product recommendations. By analyzing customer purchase data, we can discover patterns and relationships between different products, and use this information to recommend products that are likely to be of interest to a specific customer.

This code uses collaborative filtering to achieve this goal. Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses the past behavior of customers to make recommendations. In this case, we use the purchase history of customers to train a model that can make product recommendations.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to use collaborative filtering to generate personalized product recommendations for customers. We have a dataset containing customer purchase data, where each row represents an individual order and the columns include information such as Customer ID and Product Number.

## Method
I used the surprise library to implement collaborative filtering. First, I preprocessed the data by creating a rating for each product based on the number of times a customer has purchased it. Then, I used the surprise library to train an SVD model on this data.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to make product recommendations for a specific customer. The code includes an example of how to do this.

## Results
The resulting recommendations represent products that are likely to be of interest to a specific customer based on their purchase history. By recommending products that are likely to be relevant, we can increase customer satisfaction and sales.

## Performance Evaluation
The performance of the collaborative filtering model can be evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAE. In this case, the model achieved an RMSE of 0.4972 and an MAE of 0.2959 during cross-validation, indicating that it has excellent performance as both values are below 0.5.

## Future Applications
This code can be used by stores to make personalized product recommendations to their customers. By recommending products that are likely to be of interest, stores can increase customer satisfaction and sales. In addition, this analysis can be extended to other areas such as market basket analysis and customer segmentation.
