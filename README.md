# Collaborative Filtering for Product Recommendation
This code uses collaborative filtering to recommend products to customers based on their purchase history. The code uses the surprise library to implement the SVD algorithm for collaborative filtering.

Background
The code is designed to work with a dataset of customer purchase data. The data is pre-processed to create a rating for each product based on the number of times a customer has purchased it. The surprise library is then used to train an SVD model on this data and make product recommendations for a specific customer.

Usage
To use this code, you will need to have the surprise and pandas libraries installed. You will also need to have a dataset of customer purchase data in the format shown in the code.

Once you have these requirements, you can run the code to train the model and make product recommendations for a specific customer. The code includes an example of how to do this.

Potential Applications
This code can be used by stores to make personalized product recommendations to their customers. By recommending products that are likely to be of interest to a specific customer, stores can increase customer satisfaction and sales.
